Few other minor changes

Device:
Temporarily drop DC Dimming (needs kernel reimplementation)
Reduce keyguard indication bottom margin to 10dp
Kernel v2.191 state:
 - Fix 60hz jank
 - New FOD implementation fixes the following:
   - OP fod bug of rarely fod stuck on until press
   - Flash at some quick VRR transitions like rotating in a forced 60hz app
   - hbm/dim timing across devices without any per-panel hacks -- no more dim before hbm to mitigate flashbangs on 7t panel for instance
   - FOD performance difference between tap and longpress.
   - Nothing impacts fp pressed performance any longer, be it: extra dim, night light, panel mode changes, or anything else.
 - TODO still:
   - Tuned per panel dim luts (currently all are using 7p dim lut, which is surprisingly not bad
   - Reimplement DC Dim (tried few quick workarounds, really just need full reimplementation)
   - Make udfps screen off sensor trigger fp pressed (currently sensor works, but does not "wake").
